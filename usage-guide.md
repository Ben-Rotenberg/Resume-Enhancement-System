  - Specific achievements and metrics from your interview
  - Missing details and clarifications
  - Improved structure and formatting

### Step 5: Fact Verification

### Step 6: Download
- Download your enhanced resume in your preferred format:
  - Text (.txt) - For easy editing
  - PDF (.pdf) - For sharing or printing
- You can also copy the resume text directly from the interface

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: During the interview, provide concrete examples, specific achievements, and quantifiable results
2. **Add Context**: Explain the significance of your achievements and how they benefited your previous employers
3. **Be Comprehensive**: Share experiences and skills that aren't mentioned in your current resume
4. **Review Carefully**: Check the final resume for any remaining issues or areas that could be improved
5. **Customize Further**: Use the enhanced resume as a starting point and further customize it for specific job applications

## Troubleshooting

- **API Key Issues**: If you receive an error about your API key, verify that it is correct and has access to the GPT-4o model
- **Upload Errors**: If your resume fails to upload, try a different format or a simpler version of the file
- **Slow Processing**: Large resumes or lengthy interviews may take more time to process
- **Browser Issues**: If the application becomes unresponsive, try refreshing the page (you may need to restart the process)

Remember that while this system can significantly improve your resume, it's still important to review and personalize the final result to ensure it accurately represents your experience and skills.
